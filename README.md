# Somali_Tutor
This repository contains a Python application designed to translate text from English to Somali and then convert the translated text into spoken audio. The project leverages the Azure Text-to-Speech service to synthesize speech from the translated text, providing an accessible way for users to understand and interact with multilingual content.

##Features:

Text Translation: Efficiently translates English text into Somali using a translation API.
Speech Synthesis: Converts the translated Somali text into clear and understandable speech.
Language Support: While currently focused on English-to-Somali translation, the framework is designed to be adaptable for other languages supported by Azure services.
Ease of Use: Simple and intuitive interface, allowing users to input text and receive audio output seamlessly.
Technologies Used
Azure Text-to-Speech Service: For generating spoken audio from text.
Python: The entire application is written in Python, making use of several libraries for API interaction and audio handling.

##Getting Started:

Clone the Repository: git clone <repo-url>
Install Dependencies: Run pip install -r requirements.txt to install the required Python libraries.
API Keys: You will need to obtain API keys for the Azure Text-to-Speech service.

##Configuration:

Update the configuration files with your API keys and endpoint URLs.

##Usage:

Run the main script and input the English text when prompted. The application will translate the text to Somali and then play the translated speech.
