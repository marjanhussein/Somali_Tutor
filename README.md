# Somali_Tutor
This repository contains a Python application designed to translate text from English to Somali and then convert the translated text into spoken audio. The project leverages the Azure Text-to-Speech service to synthesize speech from the translated text, providing an accessible way for users to understand and interact with multilingual content.
